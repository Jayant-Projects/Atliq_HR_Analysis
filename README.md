## Overview

In this project, I took on the HR Data Analytics challenge presented by Pinali Mandalia, HR at AtliQ Technologies. The objective was to create an automated Data Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to gain valuable insights into employee preferences and wellness.

## HR Requirements

The HR team had specific goals they wanted to achieve:

1. **Employee Work Preferences:** Analyze and visualize employee preferences for remote work, differentiating between working from home and working from Office.

2. **Sick Leave Monitoring:** Calculate the percentage of sick leave to monitor and enhance employee wellness.

3. **Reasons for Remote Work:** Investigate the reasons driving frequent choices of remote work.

4. **Learning Opportunity:** Leverage this project as a valuable learning opportunity to grasp fundamental concepts of Power BI.

## Actions Taken

To meet these requirements, I took the following actions:

- **Data Analysis:** Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset and executed necessary data transformations.

- **Data Transformation:** Unpivoted columns to facilitate effective sorting and extracted additional data from the existing dataset to establish new columns.

- **DAX Measures:** Constructed DAX measures for data analysis.

- **Dashboard Design:** Designed a comprehensive dashboard, incorporating metrics, graphs, and tables as per HR's specifications.

## Key KPIs Crafted Using DAX

1. **Presence Percentage**
2. **Work From Home Percentage**
3. **Sick Leave Percentage**
4. **Present Days**
5. **Work From Home Count**
6. **Sick Leave Count**

## Results Achieved

The project yielded several valuable results:

- **Team Building:** HR can proactively plan team-building activities and team lunches to foster a more connected work environment.

- **Empowered HR:** Provided HR with a fundamental working knowledge of Power BI Desktop, empowering them for future data-driven actions and decisions.

## Key Takeaways

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience and skills:

1. **Data-Driven Narratives:** I learned to convey data-driven narratives through aesthetically pleasing dashboards.

2. **Understanding HR Needs:** I gained an in-depth understanding of HR's data-driven needs and expectations.

3. **DAX Proficiency:** I acquired proficiency in creating metrics and measures using DAX.

4. **Analytical and Visualization Skills:** I developed analytical and visualization acumen, enabling data-driven decision-making.

5. **Chart Selection:** I learned to select the most suitable chart types for effective data visualization.

6. **Problem Solving:** I harnessed effective problem-solving skills through online research.

7. **Advanced Dashboard Techniques:** I employed advanced dashboard techniques to elevate the quality of visualizations.

This project exemplifies the power of data analytics in HR and serves as a testament to the skills and knowledge gained in Power BI and data visualization.
